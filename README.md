# Prediction-Analysis-on-Titanic-Dataset
• In this project I used passenger data from the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic (1912) • The raw comma separated values (.cvs) data will be loaded into a Python (NumPy) series. • There will be some data exploration. This will be completed mostly by loading plots of different data  slices in order to better understand the data with visualization. Visualizing the data makes generating a  hypothesis easier. • A prediction model using two algorithms is used to predict how accurate the models work on the titanic  dataset and a confusion matrix is plot to clearly see the obtained results. This model is created, where,  if given some new data related to titanic, can predict if the person will/will not survive, with an accuracy  of percentage of both the algorithms implemented
